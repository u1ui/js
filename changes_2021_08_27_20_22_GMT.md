Errors:
- mod.js file missing in css\onStyleSheet\test\ directory and not included as module type. Correct file (from css\onStyleSheet\mod.js) imported within script tag later.
 SOLUTION: unnecessary script tag removed

- parser_old : script not included as module. Error occurred when trying to import a function from mod.js
 SOLUTION: script type="module" attr added

- test-helpers\ has no test.js; Error : 404
SOLUTION: mod.js (existing file) is included
